Description: An R package for fully unsupervised deconvolution of complex 
    tissues. It provides basic functions to perform 
    unsupervised deconvolution on mixture expression profiles by 
    Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) and some 
    auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific results. 
    It also implements functions to perform supervised deconvolution based on 
    prior knowledge of molecular markers, S matrix or A matrix. Combining 
    molecular markers from CAM and from prior knowledge can achieve 
    semi-supervised deconvolution of mixtures.
